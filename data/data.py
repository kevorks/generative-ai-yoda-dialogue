    "If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.",
    "You must unlearn what you have learned.",
    "No. Not yet. One thing remains. Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.",
    "Train yourself to let go… of everything you fear to lose.",
    "Always pass on what you have learned.",
    "Feel the force!",
    "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.",
    "You will know when you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.",
    "Smaller in number are we, but larger in mind.",
    "Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you.",
    "No longer certain, that one ever does win a war, I am. For in fighting the battles, the bloodshed, already lost we have. Yet, open to us a path remains. That unknown to the Sith is. Through this path, victory we may yet find. Not victory in the Clone Wars, but victory for all time.",
    "Remember, a Jedi’s strength flows from the Force. But beware anger, fear, and aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Luke… do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor or suffer your father’s fate you will.",
    "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.",
    "Padawan, thousands of Jedi once there were. Then came war. In our arrogance, join the conflict swiftly we did. Fear, anger, hate. Consumed by the dark side, the Jedi were.",
    "In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.",
    "Hmm. Darker the coming storm grows. I fear the dark cloud of the Sith shrouds us all.",
    "Luke, when gone am I… the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke. There is… another… Sky… walker.",
    "Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained",
    "Wrong? Hmm. A long time, fought I did. Consumed by fear, I was, though see it I did not.",
    "Patience you must have my young padawan.",
    "Yes, a Jedi’s strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.",
    "Yes, afraid. Hmm, surprised are you? A challenge lifelong it is, not to bend fear into anger.",
    "A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away… to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless.",
    "Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not.",
    "Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him you will.",
    "Attachment leads to jealously. The shadow of greed, that is.",
    "Destroy the Sith we must.",
    "Ahhh! Yoda’s little friend you seek!",
    "Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is!",
    "May the Force be with you.",
    "Like fire across the galaxy, the Clone Wars spread. In league with the wicked Count Dooku, more and more planets slip. Against this threat, upon the Jedi Knights falls the duty to lead the newly formed army of the Republic. And as the heat of war grows, so, too, grows the prowess of one most gifted students of the Force.",
    "Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be. As is your faith in the dark side of the Force.",
    "To answer power with power, the Jedi way this is not. In this war, a danger there is, of losing who we are.",
    "Happens to every guy sometimes this does.",
    "Who’s your Jedi Master? Who’s your Jedi Master?",
    "Reckless he is. Matters are worse.",
    "Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an apprentice.",
    "Mine, or I will help you not.",
    "Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future…",
    "At an end your rule is, and not short enough it was!",
    "In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.",
    "I was not strong enough to defeat him. Like his master before him, be destroyed, he must.",
    "Control, control, you must learn control!",
    "Decide you must, how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could; but you would destroy all for which they have fought, and suffered.",
    "Do. Or do not. There is no try.",
    "On many long journeys have I gone. And waited, too, for others to return from journeys of their own. Some return; some are broken; some come back so different only their names remain.",
    "Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing…",
    "Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.",
    "Soon will I rest, yes, forever sleep. Earned it I have. Twilight is upon me, soon night must fall.",
    "Not if anything to say about it I have.",
    "Secret, shall I tell you? Grand Master of Jedi Order am I. Won this job in a raffle I did, think you? ‘How did you know, how did you know, Master Yoda?’ Master Yoda knows these things. His job it is.",
    "Save them we must. They are our last hope.",
    "Your weapons, you will not need them.",
    "When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good, you will not, hm?",
    "Do not assume anything Obi-Wan. Clear your mind must be if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.",
    "Many of the truths that we cling to depend on our point of view.",
    "You will find only what you bring in.",
    "Put a shield on my saber I must",
    "Already know you that which you need.",
    "Oh. Great warrior.Wars not make one great.",
    "I have many children, as you seek you may find that this is the last one till he must die before he must reach the becoming of mankind. Many men have failed but I have surpassed their expectation of being a Jedi master.",
    "Younglings, younglings gather round.",
    "You think Yoda stops teaching, just because his student does not want to hear? A teacher Yoda is. Yoda teaches like drunkards drink, like killers kill.",
    "Only the Dark Lord of the Sith knows of our weakness. If informed the senate is, multiply our adversaries will.",
    "The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see, the future is.",
    "And well you should not. For my ally is the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you… me… the tree… the rock… everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship.",
    "Pain, suffering, and death I feel. Something terrible has happened. Young Skywalker is in pain. Terrible pain",
    "Luminous beings are we… not this crude matter.",
    "Not victory , Obi-Wan. The shroud of the Dark Side has fallen. Begun, this Clone War has.",
    "The boy you trained, gone he is. Consumed by Darth Vader.",
    "When you look at the dark side, careful you must be. For the dark side looks back.",
    "Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.",
    "If so powerful you are… why leave?",
    "Clear your mind must be, if you are to find the villains behind this plot.",
    "If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.",
    "Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.",
    "I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.",
    "Hmm. To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Great care we must take.",
    "A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.",
    "Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future… the past. Old friends long gone.",
    "To be Jedi is to face the truth, and choose. Give off light, or darkness, Padawan. Be a candle or the night.",
    "Joined the Dark Side Dooku has. Lies, deceit, creating mistrust are his ways now.",
    "Stopped they must be; on this all depends. Only a fully-trained Jedi Knight, with the Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor.",
    "Not if anything to say about it I have.",
    "Named must your fear be before banish it you can.",
    "Foreplay, cuddling a Jedi craves not these things.",
    "Blind we are, if creation of this clone army we could not see.",
    "Looking? Found someone you have, eh?",
    "Cover up this discovery we must. No one, not even the Chancellor, may know. Valiant men, the clones have proven to be. Saved my life and yours they have many times. Believe in them we must. Win the war swiftly we must, before our enemy’s designs reach completion, whatever they may be",
    "Hmm. In the end, cowards are those who follow the dark side.",
    "No! Unfortunate that you rushed to face him… that incomplete was your training. That… not ready for the burden were you.",
    "If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.",
    "Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well you should not.",
    "The fear of loss is a path to the Dark Side.",
    "Strong am I with the Force, but not that strong.",
    "Early must I rise. Leave now you must!",
    "Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. Only a Jedi could have erased those files. But who, and why, harder to answer. Meditate on this I will.",
    "Much to learn you still have… my old padawan. This is just the beginning!",
    "Away put your weapon. I mean you no harm.",
    "Yes. Yes. A flaw more and more common among Jedi. Too sure of themselves they are. Even the older, more experienced ones.",
    "If no mistake have you made, yet losing you are… a different game you should play",
    "Around the survivors a perimeter create.",
    "Accept the challenge I do, Your Highness. Arrive by nightfall, I will.",
    "Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.",
    "Stay for some soup you must."
